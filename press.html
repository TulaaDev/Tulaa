The investment firm also lays claim to having committed over USD 75 Mn to as many as 35 impact-focuses businesses and funds that operate across 27 different African countries. Their latest investment seems poised to further oil the machinery of a working and promising system, to benefit a wider community.

                  <br>
                  As pointed out by Ben Peterson, Senior Partner at AHL, in what appears to be a press statement issued via a LinkedIn post from the Kenyan startup’s CEO, “Tulaa’s end-to-end platform will improve crop yields while driving improved sales for small farm holder farmers, as well as deliver impressive returns to investors. We believe Tulaa has the team and the product to achieve great results.”
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The funding appears to be coming in a timely manner for the Kenyan startup and the locals. It is reported that four out of African families depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, but the dearth of access to quality inputs, affordable finance, and reliable markets hampers their chances of making a significant living out of this venture. With a view to solving this problem, Tulaa is stepping in to bridge the gap and fill that void by leveraging mobile technology and artificial intelligence to enable farmers to purchase inputs on credit, as well as market their crops efficiently at harvest time, and the latest capital injection looks set to buoy these plans. By tailoring its technology to meet the needs and demands of the last-mile retailers and traders, Tulaa looks set to make input and output markets work better for farmers.

                  As offered in the same LinkedIn post, Hillary Miller-Wise, the Kenyan startup’s Founder and CEO, expressed delight at the new development. According to her, “We are thrilled to have this group of investors on board. The consortium brings not only capital but also a terrific mix of experience and knowledge globally, as well as in the Kenyan market. Combined with the team of committed and passionate people who we have been fortunate to attract, the added experience of the investors positions us extremely well for growth.”
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  In an exclusive interview with WeeTracker, the CEO revealed the startup as being connected to both the Fin-Tech and Agri-Tech niches. She made this revelation when questioned as per whether her startup prided itself in being an Agri-Tech or Fin-Tech enterprise. When questioned further as regards how many smallholder farmers the platform has been able to reach out to and how it managed to get to them, the CEO further revealed, “Nearly 10,000 smallholder farmers have become part of Tulaa in the last one year. We employ both ATL and BTL marketing in reaching out to the farmers. Our ATL marketing strategy includes radio campaigns and agric shows. BTL involves our Field Officers and Partners, including NGOs, government extension officers, and the likes. Farmers can always register with us via USSD by dialing *384*384# on their mobile phones.”
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  As regards how the startup came in contact with the investors, the CEO told WeeTracker, “AHL is an investor in Esoko. The others came through various channels, including personal networks, networking events such as Sankalp, etc.”
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Amongst other investors in the oversubscribed round who are looking to pull resources with round leaders, AHL Venture Partners, are such firms as Global Partnerships/Eleos Social Venture Fund, Beyond Capital, and Rafiki Ventures.

                  Nairobi-based fintech platform Tulaa has closed a $627 000 seed round led by Canadian impact investor AHL Venture Partners. Tulaa, which was founded by CEO Hillary Miller-Wise in July last year, provides smallholder farmers in Kenya with access to inputs, credit and markets. The startup announced the investment yesterday in a statement on LinkedIn.

                  <br>
                  The seed funding will be used to bankroll Tulaa’s expansion in Kenya. In addition the capital will also finance the further development of the startup’s tech platform which leverages mobile technology and artificial intelligence to enable farmers to purchase inputs on credit and to market their crops efficiently at harvest time.

                  NEWS BREAKING EXCLUSIVE: Tulaa Raises $627k Seed Round for Smallholder Fintech
                  Tulaa, a Kenyan fintech startup for smallholder farmers, has raised $627k in seed funding in a round led by AHL Venture Partners, one of the largest impact-focused venture capital firms in Africa.
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  The oversubscribed round also attracted investment from other impact investment funds Global Partnerships/Eleos Social Venture Fund, Beyond Capital, and Rafiki Ventures.

                  Tulaa uses mobile technology and artificial intelligence to enable smallholder farmers to access inputs, credit and offtake markets in Kenya by connecting them to suppliers, buyers and banks. The platform also helps input suppliers, financial institutions, NGOs, coops, and commodity buyers, according to Tulaa.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  For input suppliers, the platform can aggregate demand among smallholders to help increase sales to that group as well as build brand loyalty. For banks it can help to increase their loan portfolios with smallholders as well as lower risk and provide access to data for credit risk assessment. Commodity buyers will be able to use Tulaa to aggregate and source quality produce at lower costs, and reduce the risk of handling cash through Tulaa’s mobile money payments.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The proceeds of the round will be used to expand the service to more agro-vet retailers, traders, and markets in Kenya, and to continue the development of the technology platform, especially its AI applications, according to Hillary Miller-Wise, founder and CEO of Tulaa.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  “Our main challenges stem from the complexity of managing an ecosystem,” she told AgFunderNews. “We’ve been fortunate to be able to work with excellent enterprise partners such as Syngenta or OCP. We are constantly identifying ways to align incentives for buyers and sellers on the platform, which is as much art as it is science.”
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  In July 2017, the company spun-out of Esoko, a Ghana-based mobile data service focused on smallholder farmers, and since then has amassed 10,000 farmers on the platform and is already bringing in revenues, according to Miller-Wise.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Having AHL as lead investor was very helpful for raising the round, according to Miller-Wise who added that interest from investors in platform-based businesses like Tulaa was growing.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  “Tulaa’s end-to-end platform will improve crop yields while driving improved sales for smallholder farmers and delivering impressive returns to investors,” said Ben Peterson, senior partner at AHL. “We believe Tulaa has the team and the product to achieve great results.”

                  Esoko, a pioneering social enterprise in the field of mobile agriculture, is pleased to announce that it has restructured the company and spun-off its m-commerce and data collection businesses into two new companies. This new structure allows for greater focus and growth in divergent products developed by Esoko.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Tulaa, the new mobile commerce business, enables farmers to access inputs, finance, information and markets in a virtual marketplace. Incubated inside of Esoko and launched in Ghana in 2016 and Kenya in 2017, the solution uses mobile technology and mobile money to enable farmers to save and borrow to purchase inputs, receive tailored agronomic advice, and market their crops at harvest time. Headquartered in Kenya, Tulaa will focus on growing its market share in Ghana and Kenya initially and eventually expanding into other markets. Tulaa is led by Hillary Miller-Wise, the former CEO of Esoko Networks Ltd.

              Nana Yaa Tuah is from Techiman, in the Brong Ahafo Rehion of Ghana. She registered onto Fasiba in November 2016, and was the first person to lay away money on the platform. She opted for the maize standard pack for 2 acres which cost 1,494 GHS in total. Since registering she has consistently contributed money every week and has successfully reached her goal. She now awaits delivery of the inputs to her community. Upon speaking to Nana Yaa, she explained that she is a beautician, using Fasiba for her mother, who is a smallholder farmer. Her mother often comes to her for funds to purchase inputs during planting season; which she sometimes found difficult to raise at a go. She realized her ability to raise this money affected the yield of her mother’s farm. For Nana, Fasiba is a good opportunity to save over a period of time so that she can provide the inputs to her mother when she needs it.

                  Fasiba, Esoko ‘s latest innovative technological solution, is designed to help smallholder farmers overcome the challenge of lack of access to affordable and quality inputs to increase productivity. The solution aims at creating a two-sided market for the supply and purchase of inputs, information services on Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) and digital financial services. This solution creates strategic partnerships with agro input dealers, financial institutions and Mobile Network Operators to create a virtual marketplace where farmers can access farm inputs and finance.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Before its implementation, a baseline study was conducted in three regions of Ghana with the sole purpose of collecting baseline data on smallholder farmers, against which impact, outcomes and outputs can be measured. This will then assist implementing partners to better understand broader issues affecting sustainability of agricultural inputs delivery in the target regions. A total of 314 farmers cultivating any of these three crops namely Maize, Rice, and Soybean were evaluated.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  A multi-stage cluster sampling technique was employed to enable the team capture relevant information from farmers and actors working within the selected value chains. Generally, Volta, Northern and Brong Ahafo regions are the top cropped land in Ghana. Thus, if mobile technology can be leveraged to improve input delivery to small holder farmers in these regions, productivity may improve.

                  Mobile Money Saving
                  A total of 139 farmers, representing 44.3% (< 50%) of the respondents reported they had mobile money wallet. 17.5% had saved some amount of money in their mobile money wallets. MTN mobile money wallet is the predominant mobile wallet farmers have signed up for.

                  Targeted crops
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Out of the sample, 84.4% are maize farmers. Soya is one of the least farmed crop in all three regions. Other major side crops farmers cultivate are cassava, yam, plantain, cow pea, millet, tomatoes and okra.

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Access to financial services isn’t widespread. Only 24.5% have access to loans from banks for agric purposes. High interest rates, lack of trust are the few reasons farmers are unable to access loans.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Usage of agro-input
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Usage of agro-input is low in some areas. This is mainly due to lack of finance and often times a fertile soil. Farmers default to using organic fertilizer on their farms. Others in waterlog areas decline in using fertilizer as most nutrients are washed away. Certified seeds offered to farmers by MoFA (Ministry of Food and Agriculture) extension agents are later compensated after harvest. This results in farmers spending less in acquiring seeds. Other farmers store seeds from previous harvests and use them in the next planting season.

                  Use of key certified seeds of improved variety in the last agricultural season
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Few farmers used certified seeds of improved variety in their farms to boost productivity and income. Out of the 84% of total sampled farmers who cultivate maize, only 30.3% used improved seeds on their farms. 7.3% rice farmers used improved seeds, an even much lesser percentage used certified soya seeds. Other seeds farmers indicated they had planted last season include cocoa, yam and cassava.

                  <br>
                  Maize and Rice yields in the last agricultural season have been very low. Maize yield stood at 1800kg/ha instead of 4600kg/ha, Rice at 400kg/ha instead of 4600kg/ha. On the average, soya yields 2200kg/ha.

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Farmers spend less in acquiring inputs for their farms. This is due to high cost of key inputs like fertilizer and improved seeds. In the last agricultural season, a farmer spent an average of GHC 900 ($223) worth of agric inputs on their farms, per season.

              </div>
                </div>
                <p style="margin-top:5%;text-align:left;font-size:110%;">
                  Since the launch of Fasiba in Ghana last year November, Esoko’s team of agents have been on the field all across the country sensitizing and registering smallholder farmers (SHF) onto the platform. Our aim has been to encourage SHFs to lay-away money when they have it, in order to afford quality agric inputs on the platform, when they need it. Today, we are glad to announce that we have registered our 1,000th farmer on the platform!
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  “This is an important milestone for Esoko in our quest to become the leading mobile commerce platform for farmers in Africa,” said Hillary Miller-Wise, CEO of Esoko. “We realize that it’s a single step in a 1,000 mile journey but it’s an important one in proving the demand for quality inputs among smallholder farmers .”
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  In August 2016, Esoko received grant support from The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) for the deployment of Fasiba to help 80,000 smallholder farmers in Ghana overcome challenges associated with access to affordable and quality inputs to increase productivity and incomes.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Esoko plans to launch the solution in Kenya in 2017.

              </div>
                </div>
                <p style="margin-top:5%;text-align:left;font-size:110%;">
                  Since its inception, Esoko has been a fervent supporter of open data. Our social enterprise began by collecting data and sharing this information with farmers over SMS. Studies conducted on Esoko show that access to this data has helped smallholder farmers increase their income levels. More details of these findings will be given later in the post. Suffice it to say for now that, at Esoko we can attest to the potential for data to transform lives, by informing better decisions.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                Open data presents unprecedented opportunities to improve the livelihoods of the Bottom of the Pyramid (BoP), by revealing the real problems and challenges that exist in their day-to-day lives. When governments, private sector, media and CSO’s have access to reliable and good quality data sets, they are best able to identify problem areas and create tailored solutions to these issues. This is achieved through the monitoring, tracking and analyzing of large data sets. As a society, we can only succeed in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) if we have the right data to guide stakeholders’ decisions.
                <br>
                <br>
                Unfortunately, there is a lack of information on the world’s population, especially the BoP who are the majority and most vulnerable, and hence requiring the most developmental assistance. In SSA specifically, good quality data on key development indicators is scarce. “Nowhere is the need for better data more urgent than in most African countries, where data improvements have been sluggish,” says the final report of the Data for African Development Working Group, by the Center for Global Development and the African Population and Health Research Center. The information that is available is usually outdated, incomplete or cannot be consolidated with other data sets. This presents a huge challenge for making significant progress with the SDGs.
                <br>
                <br>
                Potential of Open data in Agriculture
                <br>
                <br>
                Tackling global poverty is one area in which the potential for open data is significant and should be realized, particularly in the case of food and nutritional security. According to the World Bank, the world needs to produce at least 50% more food to feed 9 billion people by 2050. However, low productivity levels, high post-harvest losses and low incomes continue to plague the worlds’ smallholder farming population; this is particularly true in SSA. Food and nutritional security thus, requires that smallholder farmers have access to the right information to improve the efficiency of their farming activities.
                <br>
                <br>
                Esoko’s solution to these challenges has been to provide relevant data on market prices and weather information to farmers via SMS, to help them make better decisions about their farming activities, leading to better livelihoods. Simply knowing whether or not it will rain can help farmers plan fertilizer and pesticide use and improve efficient use of irrigation. This information is even more pertinent in countries where agriculture is rain fed due to poor irrigation systems. In addition, when a farmer has access to information as basic as knowing the price of maize, for example, in his surrounding markets, he has a powerful tool. He is in a better position to negotiate favorable prices with middle-men and can also decide where to sell his produce for the best price. Having access to this basic information can help farmers increase their revenues.
                <br>
                <br>
                These were some of the findings from the independent studies on Esoko’s market prices conducted by New York University (NYU) and CIRAD. In 2015, NYU published its randomized control study on Esoko, which found a 9% increase in prices received by treatment group farmers in Ghana. According to the study, this 9% increase in price for an average yam farmer translated to 18% increase in profit margins. CIRAD (2010) also observed an average 10% increase in revenues among participants receiving Esoko’s market prices.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although farmers face many challenges when it comes to increasing productivity levels, (e.g. access to inputs and capital), there is a strong incentive to produce more when they know they can get more income for their produce. Also, improving incomes for farmers in SSA is a huge step in the fight against poverty, as smallholder farmers constitute one of the poorest populations in the region.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our work is an example of one of the many ways in which open data can help achieve the UN SDG to fight global poverty. It also illustrates the importance and role of mobile technology, and technology in general, in putting open data to good use.
                <br>
                <br>
                Esoko lends its full support to GODAN’s initiative to free up data on agriculture and nutrition as a way to eradicate poverty in accordance to the SDG’s. As a social enterprise, we will continue to explore the many innovative ways in which open data and technology can be joined together for the greater public good.

                “Of the 100,000 farmers in Ghana currently using Esoko services, As much as over 60% are located in the northern part of the country and our aim is to be closer to these farmers and the development organizations and agribusinesses that work with these farmers” said Daniel Asare-Kyei, Managing Director of Esoko, in his welcome address at the launch ceremony. He further stated that given that the three Northern Regions are among the nation’s major food baskets with major agriculture potential, there was no better way for Esoko to make significant impact in the agriculture than to be located at the heart of it and work with the key actors looking to give real meaning to Africa’s green revolution using technology.

                Mark Davies, the Founder of Esoko, urged stakeholders in the agriculture industry, from businesses to NGO’s to government agencies, to work closely with Esoko in guiding the company shape its services and products to existing needs. In his opinion, “the ultimate growth of the agricultural industry is businesses talking to businesses, and businesses providing services to farmers and other agricultural businesses” and to make this work requires engagement, advice and help from all the stakeholders involved.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Esoko Tamale Branch will focus on developing business relationships with partners in the Northern sector of the country and handling all projects in the territory. It will be home to Esoko Project Coordinators and Business Advisors, and will be headed by a Northern Sector Manager. The office is located at 840 Rice City, Gumani-Tamale, on the Tamale-Bolga road.

              Nana Yaa Tuah is from Techiman, in the Brong Ahafo Rehion of Ghana. She registered onto Fasiba in November 2016, and was the first person to lay away money on the platform. She opted for the maize standard pack for 2 acres which cost 1,494 GHS in total. Since registering she has consistently contributed money every week and has successfully reached her goal. She now awaits delivery of the inputs to her community. Upon speaking to Nana Yaa, she explained that she is a beautician, using Fasiba for her mother, who is a smallholder farmer. Her mother often comes to her for funds to purchase inputs during planting season; which she sometimes found difficult to raise at a go. She realized her ability to raise this money affected the yield of her mother’s farm. For Nana, Fasiba is a good opportunity to save over a period of time so that she can provide the inputs to her mother when she needs it.

In Africa, 40% of the population now have access to internet browsing on their phones according to It News Africa, while ownership of smartphones continue to increase in the continent. As mobile device usage strengthens in Africa, projects related to economic stabilization, including technological advancements in farming and agriculture, have blossomed.

                  Mobile devices provide the farming sector plenty of benefits. First, it is the best means of communication – whether accessing forecasts, fluctuating market prices, or even helpful livestock care tips – especially, for farmers in the developing countries.

                  <br>
                  Today, platforms that offer communication tools for businesses, the government, and NGOs in connecting with farmers have started offering effective ways to improve the future of farming in Africa. In particular, Esoko offers an easy-to-use and simple tool for marketing, monitoring, and advisory needs of the sector by mixing web and mobile apps, informative agricultural content, and deployment services.

                  With specific apps, farmers and businesses are aided with day-to-day information that is vital to their daily work, such as sourcing weather reports and prices for crops. Since unexpected weather conditions can cost farmers significant amounts of money, mobile services that offer them a safety net when it comes to rains, floods, droughts, pests, and diseases become essential to safeguard crops during inclement conditions.

                  Over time, we have seen how farming has also inspired mobile technology, where games featuring barns, farmers, and farm animals have been released on the gaming market. Who could forget the very popular online game FarmVille that was once only available as a Facebook game but has since expanded its reach to a mobile app. Even after five years on the market, CNN suggest millions of players still play the game. Other farm-inspired titles have also appeared online and in mobile games, such as the popular ‘Little Pigs Strike Back’ and ‘Piggy Payout’ which are featured among vast array of titles on Spin Genie. And while these gaming titles certainly won’t help farmers increase profits or monitor their crops and live stock it does show the popularity mobile devices and their respective apps are nowadays.

                  <br>
                  Currently, about 13% of African farmers utilize phones for agricultural purposes, but GSMA project the number to rise 30% by 2020.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  “The mobile phone is a ubiquitous tool present in all remote places, especially in villages, where it is sometimes the only piece of technology people own,” said former head of digital operations at Millicom International Cellular Alexandre N’djore. “If we want African farmers to have the same knowledge as farmers do in other parts of the world, [the] mobile phone is the best tool.”
